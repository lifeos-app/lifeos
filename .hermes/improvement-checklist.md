- 2026-04-22: Full branch audit + feature accessibility fix. ROOT CAUSE: LOCAL_USER in electron-api.ts used `new Date().toISOString()` as created_at → accountDays=0 → all progressive-disclosure features (Academy/Character/Replicator/Lessons) were hidden every session. Fixed: hardcoded '2020-01-01' so local users always see all features. Also lowered revealAfterDays thresholds (5→2, 7→3). TCS plugin gate confirmed working — auto-enables for tewedross12@gmail.com/teddyscleaning emails. All 14 routes confirmed present in App.tsx. Clean build + relaunch. Score: 46/68 = 67.6%.

Annotated TD-010 as deployment action. Score: 54/89 = 60.7%.
- 2026-04-25: Executed 3 items.
